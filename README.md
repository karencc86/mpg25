# üöó FUEL CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS: MPG DATASET

This project explores the `mpg` (miles per gallon) dataset in the `seaborn` Python library. The analysis focuses on the fuel consumption of automobiles manufactured between 1970 and 1982, including variables such as displacement, weight, and engine power.

## üìö CONTEXT

The dataset comes from the Auto MPG dataset, originally collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

During the analysis, relevant historical context was incorporated, such as the 1973 oil crisis, which directly affected the global automotive industry and generated a transition towards more fuel-efficient vehicles.

## üõ†Ô∏è LIBRARIES

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy)

## üìà OBJECTIVES

‚ùñ Analyze the relationship between dataset variables and their impact on fuel efficiency (MPG).

‚ùñ Identify patterns and trends in vehicle efficiency by displacement, weight and horsepower.

‚ùñ Evaluate performance differences between cars of different origins and mechanical configurations.

‚ùñ Determine the most influential factors in vehicle acceleration.

‚ùñ Extract key findings to enable informed automotive decision-making.


## üìä FINDINGS
‚ùñ There is an inverse relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency.

‚ùñ Vehicles with a higher number of cylinders have lower efficiency and lower acceleration.

‚ùñ Car weight is a determining factor in fuel consumption.

‚ùñ Lighter cars with smaller displacements present better MPG performance.

‚ùñ Consistent patterns were identified in performance differences by vehicle region of origin.

‚ùñ Japanese and European cars have better fuel efficiency compared to U.S. cars.

‚ùñ Models with high power-to-displacement ratios achieve better energy efficiency without sacrificing performance.

## üßê‚òùüèºÔ∏è SUGGESTIONS
The analysis confirms that smaller and lighter engines offer better fuel efficiency, while larger and more powerful engines consume more gasoline. It is recommended to consider these factors when designing strategies for fuel consumption optimization in the automotive industry.

For future studies, it is suggested to:

‚óè Include additional variables such as aerodynamics and transmission technology for further analysis.

‚óè Analyze the historical evolution of these trends to understand how efficiency standards have changed over time.

‚óè Evaluate the impact of new technologies such as hybrid and electric motors compared to traditional models.

‚óè Conduct a more detailed analysis by country to understand how regulations affect vehicle design.

‚óè These findings can be useful to manufacturers and consumers in making informed efficiency and performance decisions in the purchase and production of automobiles.
